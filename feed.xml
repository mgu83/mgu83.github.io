I hosted an early Friendsgiving dinner this year. On the menu, there was:</p> <ul> <li>Creamy carrot soup</li> <li>Garlic green beans</li> <li>Creamy roasted garlic mashed potatoes with homemade turkey</li> <li>Turkey</li> <li>my famous Mac n Cheese</li> <li>Stuffed mushrooms with whipped ricotta and hierloom tomatoes</li> <li>Homemade pita bread</li> <li>Homemade rosemary focaccia</li> </ul> <p>Although every thing seemed to be a big hit, the mac n cheese was the star of the show. Those who have tried it knows that I make the recipe once a year, which made the lead up to dinner especially special.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/IMG_4452-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/IMG_4452-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/IMG_4452-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/IMG_4452.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="Mac n Cheese" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/IMG_4432-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/IMG_4432-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/IMG_4432-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/IMG_4432.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="Stuffed Mushrooms" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/IMG_4435-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/IMG_4435-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/IMG_4435-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/IMG_4435.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="Hierloom Tomatoes" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> On the left, my Mac n Cheese was the star, despite it not looking like much. Middle, stuffed mushrooms with a creamy garlicky filling. Right, look how gorgeous the hierloom tomatoes are. </div> <p>We had so much food that a seperate table was required to host half the other dishes. Overall, I am very happy with how everything turned out! I thought the table looked lovely.</p> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-sm-12 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/IMG_4443-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/IMG_4443-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/IMG_4443-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/IMG_4443.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="Place Settings" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> This time of the year always makes me think about how I can support others around me who may not be as fortunate as I am. Although I was unable to volunteer at the food bank, I was able to bring leftover food to those who are unhoused and/or were unable to celebrate with anyone else. </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="memory"/><category term="images"/><category term="food"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[a thanksgiving celebration]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">books you MUST read</title><link href="https://mgu83.github.io/blog/2023/recommended-books/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="books you MUST read"/><published>2023-09-30T07:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-09-30T07:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://mgu83.github.io/blog/2023/recommended-books</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://mgu83.github.io/blog/2023/recommended-books/"><![CDATA[<p>I have always been an avid reader since I was young.
