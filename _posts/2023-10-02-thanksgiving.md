Dinner parties is the perfect intersection of three of my favourite things: cooking, taking pictures and my friends. I hosted an early Friendsgiving dinner this year. On the menu, there was:

- Creamy carrot soup
- Garlic green beans 
- Creamy roasted garlic mashed potatoes with homemade turkey
- Turkey
- my famous Mac n Cheese
- Stuffed mushrooms with whipped ricotta and hierloom tomatoes
- Homemade pita bread
- Homemade rosemary focaccia 

Although every thing seemed to be a big hit, the mac n cheese was the star of the show. Those who have tried it knows that I make the recipe once a year, which made the lead up to dinner especially special.

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/IMG_4452.jpg" title="Mac n Cheese" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/IMG_4432.jpg" title="Stuffed Mushrooms" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/IMG_4435.jpg" title="Hierloom Tomatoes" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>

    On the left, my Mac n Cheese was the star, despite it not looking like much. Middle, stuffed mushrooms with a creamy garlicky filling. Right, look how gorgeous the hierloom tomatoes are.

We had so much food that a seperate table was required to host half the other dishes. Overall, I am very happy with how everything turned out! I thought the table looked lovely.

This time of the year always makes me think about how I can support others around me who may not be as fortunate as I am. Although I was unable to volunteer at the food bank, I was able to bring leftover food to those who are unhoused and/or were unable to celebrate with anyone else.
