I had six of my best friends over for an early Thanksgiving dinner this past Saturday. Truthfully, I used the event to cook an `elaborate` feast. Asides from the traditional turkey and gravy, there was also:
1. Creamy Carrot Soup
2. Sauteed Garlic Green Beans 
3. Creamy Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes
4. Gooey, Cheesy Mac n Cheese
5. Whipped Ricotta, Olive Hummus & Artichoke Dip w/ Homemade Pita & Hierloom Tomatoes
6. Homemade Rosemary Sea Salt Focaccia 
7. Stuffed Mushrooms

I think all the dishes turned out well, but there is no doubt, the star of the show was the Mac n Cheese. I make it once a year for my friends, specifically for Thanksgiving, which made it highly anticipated.
