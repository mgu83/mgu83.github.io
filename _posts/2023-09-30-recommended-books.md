I have always been an avid reader since I was young. I embarked on thrilling journeys, whether sailing the treacherous seas with Captain Ahab in pursuit of whales or standing alongside skilled surgeons performing intricate cardiac surgeries. Each page offered a new adventure, a fresh perspective, and an endless source of knowledge. Here are some of my favourite books that I think you should read.

- <h5>Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen</h5> A classic for a reason. I regularly re-read this. 

- <h5> <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/09/13/a-cautionary-tale-about-science-raises-uncomfortable-questions-about-fiction"></a>When We Cease to Understand the World by Benjam√≠n Labatut</h5> Genuinely one of the best that I have read in the last few years. Every time someone asks me for a book recommendation, this is the first that pops into mind. 

- <h5>Everything I Know About Love by Dolly Alderton</h5> Has an important message for women in their 20s and 30s, conveyed through a verociously interesting and relatable memoir.
