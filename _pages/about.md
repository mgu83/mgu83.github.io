Currently taking a break after graduating with my Computer Engineering degree at the University of British Columbia.

I am back in my hometime and spend my days taking care of family, and working on home improvement projects. I have spent
plenty of time watching YouTube videos about how to spackle drywall and the best way to encourage grass growth 
(use a spreader and plenty of water BTW). 

Even though I have limited time nowadays, I really like to read. "Good Morning, Monster" by Catherine 
Gildiner was the last book that had me in tears. 



<!-- Currently studying computer engineering at the University of British Columbia. 

I just finished up an [app](/projects/EduMatch) with some friends and wrote a basic operating system using [OS161](http://www.os161.org/) (in C!) I am currently expanding my web scraper grocery app idea by adding a computer vision element that will allows users to easily track what is in their fridge. Take a look at [projects page](/projects)

Hoping to write some posts about personal finance, engineering and new technologies. `Fun fact`: I daytraded for three years and yielded some significant returns!

If you are a recruiter, you're probably looking for my [cv](/cv). I am going to be working at Amazon as well as doing research at the [SALT Lab](https://salt.ece.ubc.ca/) this summer! I am currently looking for full time roles starting Summer or Fall 2025.  -->



<!-- Write your biography here this is maggie and i am here testing. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
