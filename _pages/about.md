Currently studying computer engineering and math at the University of British Columbia. 

Lately, I have been working on an [app](/projects/EduMatch) with some friends and also writing parts of [OS161](http://www.os161.org/) (in C!) Take a look at [projects page](/projects)

Hoping to write some posts about personal finance, engineering and new technologies. `Fun fact`: I daytraded for three years and yielded some significant returns!

If you are a recruiter, you're probably looking for my [cv](/cv). I just finished up working at a cancer research lab and am currently doing `Full-Stack` at a startup.

Please be patient with me as I update my website! These pages are a work in process.

<!-- Write your biography here this is maggie and i am here testing. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
