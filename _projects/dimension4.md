Calculating sphere packing bounds in dimension 4 via harmonic analysis ("linear programming bounds"). Inspired by [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04246) and my algebra & code theory class which I will expand on as I learn more about linear programming. Currently working on a mini-project in conjunction to this where I create a program that encodes and decodes codes based on inputted parameters. 

Take a look at the [current best packing densities](https://cohn.mit.edu/sphere-packing)!

More details coming soon...
