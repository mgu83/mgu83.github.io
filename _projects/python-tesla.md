Problem: Tesla consisted of multiple locations across Fremont Factory. Due to the everchanging work done to the assembly lines and infrastructure, employees may need to capture reference photos of any key areas. However, the main Fremont Factory is already over 5 million sq ft so it can be hard to specify which area the location was taken. 

Solution: Python script that reads and processes the pictures' metadata that help organize the images and tags them to the correct area of the factory on the virtual map.
