I come from Interior BC and have watched as the areas around me go up in flames every summer. The situation gets worse and worse every summer. This sparked the idea to build a `low-cost, portable, self-sustaining module` to allow for real-time wildfire monitoring, specifically in remote regions. The goal is to provide communities with the tools they need to respond quickly and effectively to wildfire threats, while also collecting critical environmental data to inform future prevention and management efforts. 
	
The wildfire detection module consists of two parts: the physical module and applications. The physical module consists of `multiple sensors` contained in a waterproof box that collects and sends real-time data to the server.  This is all `powered via solar panels` on top of the box. The data is then `analyzed to be used to predict and detect fires` which can help alert users with the web and phone app.

This project integrated both hardware and software skills. In addition to being group leader (me + 3) and assisting wherever possible, I completed the entire mobile app and the backend and most of the front-end of the web app. For frontend, I used `React, Bootstrap & TailwindCSS` and then `LAMP` stack for backend.

Below are the few pictures that I have.
