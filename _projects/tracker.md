I started working at a start-up doing full-stack early in 2023. It was a great opportunity to work on front-end as well as back-end, especially on a team that was growing quite quickly. 

The main product that my company provides is a media-relations tracker geared to media teams to help them keep track of media requests. You can learn more [here](https://www.broadsighttracker.ca/).

My most recent push was a Asana-like calendar feature that allowed users to filter and display various media-related data. I worked on the feature from start (e.g. figuring out libraries to use, Figma frames etc) to delivering the end product, as well as plenty of debugging in between. It actually helped me understand the overall product a lot more as I had only worked on certain parts of features prior to working on the calendar.
