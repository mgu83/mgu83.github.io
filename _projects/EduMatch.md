This project was the work myself and three of my friends. The idea was to create a tutor finding app that students in search of tutors can use to find a tutor who suits their academic needs. Tutors who wish to advertise their services will set up a profile on this platform, detailing key information such as location, subject offerings, and pricing. Tutees can browse and filter tutor profiles based on the above information, as well as tutorsâ€™ ratings received from previous tutees.

The app includes: real-time live chat, integration of external APIs including Google Maps API, UBC Grades API, and Google Calendar API and a tutor recommendation algorithm that we designed ourselves. 

Here, you can see a simplified diagram of the components of our app.
